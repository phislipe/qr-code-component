### What I learned

Doing this project was way more interesting than I thought it would be. I struggled a bit with how to center a div vertically. After some research, I discovered I was only missing the height property for the flex to work correctly.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

After much refactoring, I was able to make the QR code card stay centered on the page using less code.

Also pretend to look more into `box-shadow`, since I'm not really happy with what it is right now.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/396145/how-can-i-vertically-center-a-div-element-for-all-browsers-using-css) - This 13-year-old post helped me figure out how to center a div vertically. At first, I was using three divs to be able to center one of them vertically. After reading through it, I made it work properly with `flexbox`(a much simpler solution).
